# Matthew McLean's copy of dominion code for assignment 5

To compile and run all tests, do the following:

```
make runtests
```

This will generate testresults.out with the test output and gcov coverage information. If the .out file already exists, you must remove it prior to running this (make clean works here), or the result will be concatenated onto the existing files.
